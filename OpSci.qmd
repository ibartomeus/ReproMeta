## Can we do better?

## Open Science is hard

> "Caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar" Machado et al. 1912 probably referring to open science

Open, reliable and transparent science is a path, not and end point.

## My path

-   It took me 10 years to approach something I am comfortable calling Open Reliable Transparent science.

<!-- -->

-   Work iteratively. One step at a time.

-   We stand on the shoulders of giants such as [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) and [Paco Rodriguez](https://github.com/Pakillo) (or you don't need to walk this path alone, find your community)

## Conclusions

-   It's hard work -\> Ensure to claim the credit you deserve

-   You are more exposed -\> You faults will be seen as honest

-   New tools and standards emerge every day -\> Work iteraltively and strive to do better, not to do it perfect.

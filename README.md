# ReproMeta

Example of a reproducible workflow to run meta-analysis. The objective of this repo is to use the 
GLiTRS Multithreat Meta-Analytic Database for Understanding Insect Biodiversity Change and create 
a dynamic pipeline to analyze the data in a reproducible way.

To that end we will use:
- GLiTRS open data: https://github.com/Joemillard/GlitrsDynametaLocal
- Quarto: A Markdown-like syntaxis to combine text and R code and generate documents.
- Github: A version control system to track changes as we go.
- Zenodo: A platform to ensure stable releases with a permanent DOI.

Content of this repo:

- README.md: The most important file to understand what this repo is about. 
All your projects need a README.md
- `workflow.qmd`: Step by ste guide on how to be reproducible, open, and a very cool R coneiseure.
This is where you should start.
- `demo.qmd`: The skeleton of a dynamic analysis. You can clone this skeleton and create yours
- `OpSci.qmd` (and .html): A rpesentation about Open Science
- LICENCE: Always let people know what they can do with your code. In this case, its cc-by
- `/docs`: The folder where the webpage lives.
- `scripts`: A folder with used sripts, including setting the environment, metadata, etc...

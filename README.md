All your projects need a README.md
- `workflow.qmd`: Step by ste guide on how to be reproducible, open, and a very cool R coneiseure.
This is where you should start.
- `demo.qmd`: The skeleton of a dynamic analysis. You can clone this skeleton and create yours
- Licence: Always let people know what they can do with your code. In this case, its cc-by
